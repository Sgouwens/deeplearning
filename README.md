# deeplearning
In here, multiple deep learning algorithms are programmed using pytorch.
Currently implemented:

* Data imputation using Generative adversarial nets (GAN) using the GAIN methodology
* Maximum likelihood estimation using Neural Network functions to model parameters
* Image generation using GAN's
* A simple MNIST classifier network
